Access control mechanism

This is a manager for Apache group files.

Suppose you have a WebDAV directory tree rooted at $docs (see modutil.pl).
Add an .htaccess file to restrict access. In this file, also add:

AuthGroupFile /etc/accesscontrol/groupcontrol

Put all the files from the distribution in some CGI-executable place and
protect it with the included htaccess file (which you might have to rename from
htaccess to .htaccess).

Now edit modutil.pl and fix the file paths at the top. Watch out for the path
to $file -- this should be same as AuthGroupFile above. The groupcontrol file,
wherever you put it, must be writeable and readable by the web server.

Add .htacess files to the sub-directories like so:

<Limit MKCOL PUT DELETE LOCK UNLOCK COPY MOVE PROPPATCH POST OPTIONS PROPFIND>
Require Group dirname_write
</Limit>
<Limit GET PROPFIND PROPPATCH>
Require Group dirname_read
</Limit>


or, point your browser to moddir.pl, which creates directories and sets up the
.htaccess for you.

dirname is the name of the sub-directory. Instead of "Require Group (whatever)"
you can also have "Require valid-user" to allow allow authenticated people
access to the resource. See your web-server's documentation.

This assumes WebDAV. If you have a plain directory tree, or something else,
please see your web server documentation.
